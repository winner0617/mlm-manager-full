It's time to run unit tests.

Under directory "SAMPLE_MLM":
1) copy file "Beancon.pm" to "mlm/lib/MLM"
2) copy file "admin.t" to "mlm/lib/MLM/Admin"
3) copy file "placement.t" to "mlm/lib/MLM/Placement"

So the directory structure for the three new files looks like

mlm/lib/MLM
           /Beacon.pm
           /Admin
                 /admin.t
           /Placement
                 /placement.t

4) edit the files so "SAMPLE_home" points to the current top directory.
5) go to "mlm/lib/MLM/Admin" and run
$ perl admin.t
to make sure the unit tests pass
6) go to "mlm/lib/MLM/Placement" and run
$ perl placement.t
to make sure the unit tests pass
